# 100-codes-Project

## Self learn project 

This is pure self learning path that I started workingn on. My aim is to finish a 100 codes to develop my knowledge and make sure I am upto date with different code aspects. I found a repository which suggests 100 codes that I should try out and I am planninng to try that out one by one.

The link for the repository that I am looking at is as below:
